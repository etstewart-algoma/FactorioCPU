# FactorioCPU
A turing-complete CPU built inside factorio using it's combinator system features a instruction set ready to use and a simple compiler

# Optional Extras
These things are required to use the cpu but you may lose some commands or details
The text plate mdo should be installed for extra tooltips around the cpu 
THe space age DLC also while isn't required grants you access to a larger instruction set that the cpu can use.


# How to use 
1. Import the Blueprint Base for the CPU into a factorio save.
2. create a code.fac file and write a program based on the instruction set.
3. Run main.py in that folder you will get text file with a factorio blueprint string.
4. Paste that string in game and enjoy your working program.


# Why make This?
Factorio combinators while very powerful can be very confusing. 
Especially if you are trying to perform more complicated logic, Therefore i decided to make this instruction set and cpu so
even people without intimatide knowledge of how factorio combinators work can still make complex things with them for there base so long
as they have a general computer science background.
